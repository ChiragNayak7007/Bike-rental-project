# Bike-rental-project

My objective of the analysis is to find out predictions of bike rental count on daily based on
the environmental and seasonal settings, construct statistical models and then try to make
prediction on rentals based on the information and models which I have. My exploration and
the analysis of the data will be performed in Jupyter Notebook using Python; Tableau will be
used for visualization.
